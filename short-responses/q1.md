# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
The middleware function can determine which controller is needed while controllers respond to a request. Middleware doesn't return any info to the user, but passes request to a specific controller which is what returns the response to the user.

While middleware can be used in this instance, the main difference is that middleware doesn't return anything directly to the user. Instead, it processes requests and passes them along to the next function in the stack, whereas controllers are responsible for sending the final response to the user.
